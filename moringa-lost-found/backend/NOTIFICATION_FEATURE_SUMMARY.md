## üìù Usage Examples

### Rejecting an Item with Reason
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/items/admin/123/reject \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN' \
     -d '{"reason": "Description too vague. Please provide more details."}'
```

### Getting User Notifications
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/notifications \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN'
```

### Response Example
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 123,
    "title": "Item Rejected",
    "message": "Your item 'Lost iPhone' has been rejected by an administrator. Reason: Description too vague. Please provide more details.",
    "type": "error",
    "is_read": false,
    "item_id": 456,

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **User submits item** ‚Üí Item status: `pending`
2. **Admin reviews item** ‚Üí Views pending items list
3. **Admin makes decision**:

   - **Reject**: Item status ‚Üí `rejected`, user gets error notification with reason
4. **User receives notification** ‚Üí Can view reason and take action
5. **User manages notifications** ‚Üí Mark as read, delete, etc.
