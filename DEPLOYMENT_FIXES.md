# Backend Fixes for 500 Error on Signup

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Blueprint Registration Conflict
- **Problem**: Auth controller was defining its own blueprint AND being imported as a blueprint
- **Fix**: Removed blueprint decorators from auth_controller.py and used proper route registration in auth_routes.py

### 2. Duplicate Model Definitions
- **Problem**: Reward model was defined in both `reward.py` and `report.py`
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate Reward model from `report.py` and updated all imports

### 3. Relationship Conflicts
- **Problem**: Multiple conflicting backref definitions between User, Comment, and other models
- **Fix**: Cleaned up relationship definitions to avoid conflicts

### 4. Model Schema Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: Model definitions didn't match the latest database migrations
- **Fix**: Updated models to match migration schema

## Files Changed:

1. `app/controllers/auth_controller.py` - Removed blueprint decorators, improved error handling
2. `app/models/report.py` - Removed duplicate Reward model, added missing fields, fixed relationships
3. `app/models/reward.py` - Updated to match migrations, fixed nullable fields
4. `app/models/user.py` - Fixed relationship conflicts
5. `app/controllers/item_controller.py` - Fixed imports
6. `app/controllers/report_controller.py` - Fixed imports
7. `app/controllers/report_reward_controller.py` - Fixed imports
8. `tests/test_controllers.py` - Fixed imports

## Deployment Steps Required:

1. **Push changes to repository**
2. **Redeploy backend on Render** (this will automatically happen if connected to Git)
3. **Run database migrations** on the deployed database:
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

## Verification:
After deployment, test the signup endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST https://moringa-lost-found-api.onrender.com/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","password":"testpass"}'
```

Expected response: `{"message": "User created successfully"}` with status 201
